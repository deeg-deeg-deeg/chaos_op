-----------------------------------------

There is a max4live device available called "Norns_OSC_2" which you'll need to receive Chaos OPs output via OSC in Ableton Live. 

https://github.com/deeg-deeg-deeg/Norns_OSC_2

If you want to send via OSC you have to specify the receiver address and port in the code at line 92: osc_dest =  {"192.168.1.3",9001}
I haven't found a good way to input it via a menu in Norns. 

Cheers!

UPDATE:
Added better MIDI support. You can select midi device and channel to send on via the EDIT menu.
And a MANUAL is now available under: <a href="https://github.com/deeg-deeg-deeg/manuals">https://github.com/deeg-deeg-deeg/manuals</a>
